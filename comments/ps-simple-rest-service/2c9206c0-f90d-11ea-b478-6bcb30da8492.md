Thank you for this write up!  I followed it and in ~8 dev hours went from knowing zero purescript to a PSQL+REST server which tracks players scores for a bug bash.

The tutorial itself is a bit dated - modules have moved around and some types have changed.  Still it was very followable when combined with lots of searching on pursuit.

About the only thing missing is a good deployment strategy, but that's probably more my own technical weakness than anything PureScript related.  Reading below I see trex has a lambda solution working.  Would love to see a similar tutorial that is more about deployment.
