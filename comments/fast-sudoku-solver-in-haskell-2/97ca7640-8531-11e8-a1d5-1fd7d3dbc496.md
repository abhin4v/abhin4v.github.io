Additional interesting facts:  If I remove the "-threaded", "-rtsopts" and "-with-rtsopts=-N" from the package.yaml file, the program runs on a single thread.  It actually finishes faster (about twice as fast) than it did when it used all 32 threads.  It's still a bit slower for me than it was for you, but now reasonably so.
