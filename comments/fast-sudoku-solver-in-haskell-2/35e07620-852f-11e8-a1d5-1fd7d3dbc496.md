@Abhinav  On my desktop, the program is using all the hardware threads (I watched it in htop).  This definitely surprised me too, since there's no parallelism explicit in the source.  Perhaps the -threaded option in the package.yaml file is causing GHC to do some smart automated threading around the forM_?
