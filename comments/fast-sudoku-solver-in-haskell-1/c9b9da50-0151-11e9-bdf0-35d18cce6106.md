I'm really enjoying this and trying to follow along but I'm wondering is the ```case xs Data.List.\\ fixeds of case...``` part has a mistake? I can't seem to figure how to make this bit work but the same thing is present in your source code all through the history so it seems like it must have worked at some point. Any help or clarification would be much appreciated!
