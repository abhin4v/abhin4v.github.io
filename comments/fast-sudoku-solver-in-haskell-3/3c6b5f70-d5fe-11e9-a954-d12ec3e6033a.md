Hi Abhinav, thanks for your writeup. I never used haskell but came here as I am currently building my own constraint solver in Julia and tackle sudoku in the first four posts of my series (<https://opensourc.es/blog/constraint-solver-1>) and tried some other ideas as well which you might be interested in. Besides that have you read:

- <https://norvig.com/sudoku.html>
- <https://t-dillon.github.io/tdoku/>

They are very interesting as well where the later is a very very fast sudoku solver.
