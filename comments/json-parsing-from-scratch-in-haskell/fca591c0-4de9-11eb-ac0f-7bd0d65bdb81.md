Excellent article! I really appreciated the way you clearly walked through things and explained most of what you were doing and the helpful links throughout. One question that I have though is about your implementations for  jIntFrac and jIntFracExp. I had assumed that they would look very similar to the implementations for jInt and jIntExp. Indeed, while following along, I implemented them along the lines of jInt and jIntExp instead, and everything still works. Are your alternative implementations some kind of optimization for how the compiler evaluates things?
