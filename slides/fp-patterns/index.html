???

- what is the biggest challenge for programmers these days?
- it's complexity
- thanks for Moore's law and improvements in compilers and runtimes, we don't need to care about nitty-gritties of performance of most of the programs we write anymore
- and thanks to the same, the computers are running the world now.
- which has lead to more and more complex things being implemented in software.

---

# Complexity

- Complexity is the degree of entanglement in software.
- Complex programs are hard to understand and hence hard to change.

???

- I bet you have seen complex codebases
- These are generally codebases which no one wants to touch
- Development of these projects get slower and slower and finally you do a massive rewrite hoping that it'll make working on these projects fast again
- Fred Brooks discussed complexity in great details in his 1986 paper titled "No Silver Bullet – Essence and Accident in Software Engineering".
- In the paper, Fred classifies complexity in two categories: Essential and Accidental.

---

# Essential Complexity

- Required for solving the problem at hand.
  - Like implementing Breadth-first search algorithm for finding the shortest path.
  - It is unavoidable regardless of which tools and frameworks you use.

---

# Accidental Complexity

- Not inherent to the problem; brought while writing the program.
--

  - Choose to use _C_? Now you have to manage memory too.
--

  - Choose to use _Java_? Now you have to model everything as objects.
--

  - Choose to use _node_? Now you have to deal with 3 million dependencies.

Rube Goldberg Machine

???

- rude goldberd machine
  - fragile and opaque
  - things break easily and mysteriously when trying to make changes
- good programmers seek to reduce accidental complexity as much as possible
- i claim that functional programming helps in reducing accidental complexity as compared to OOP

# Functional Programming

> Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.

---

# FP: Salient Aspects

- pure functions
???
- a function is pure if it's output depends only on it's input and nothing else
- easier to reason about and debug because they don't depend on mutable state
- easier to test because there are no dependencies
- §
--

- first-class and higher-order functions
???
- first-class functions can be passed to and returned from functions
- functions which take or return functions are called higher-order functions
- §
--

- no/constrained mutable state
???
- mutable state leads to coupling between components
- mutable state requires synchronization when working with multiple threads
- FP eschews mutable state
- FP languages are immutable by default and mutability is opt-in by using specific constructs
- §
--

- no/constrained side-effects
???
- side effects are any changes in state that do not depend on the function inputs
- IO is side effect too
- code with side effects is harder to reason about
- FP languages provide specific constructs to constrain side effects
- §
--

- optionally, lazy evaluation and static type system
???
- some FP languages come with lazy evaluation and/or static type systems

---
```javascript

let meetups =
  [{name: 'JS', isActive: true, members: 700},
   {name: 'Clojure', isActive: true, members: 900},
   {name: 'Java', isActive: false, members: 600},
   {name: 'Go', isActive: true, members: 500}];

let totalMembers = meetups
  .filter(m => m.isActive)
  .map(m => m.members)
  .reduce((acc, m) => acc + m, 0);
```

# Clojure
---

# Clojure
--

- dynamically typed
--

- functional programming language
--

- from the Lisp family
--

- runs on JVM

---

# Clojure

```clojure
(def meetups
  [{:name "JS" :is-active true :members 700}
   {:name "Clojure" :is-active true :members 900}
   {:name "Java" :is-active false :members 600}
   {:name "Go" :is-active true :members 500}])

(def total-members
  (->> meetups
    (filter :is-active)
    (map :members)
    (reduce (fn [acc m] (+ acc m)) 0)))
```

# Functional Programming Patterns

1. Immutable Data; Explicit State
1. Dataflow Programming
1. Explicit over Implicit
1. Common Data Structures over Custom Objects
1. Data-oriented Programming
1. Functional Core; Imperative Shell
