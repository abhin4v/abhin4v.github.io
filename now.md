# What I'm Doing Now

I'm living in Bangalore, India and working at [Google].

## Reading

I'm trying to get back into the habit of reading technical (and non-technical) books. The years 2018-19 were quite bad in terms of reading. This year I'm planning to devote more time to reading (and listening to) and finish at least fifteen books.

## Running and Cycling

I'm [training] to run a half marathon race for past couple of months. I'm also trying to commute to work more frequently on my bicycle.

## Blogging

I'm planning to write more programming focussed blog posts. The last post for my [Fast Sudoku Solver in Haskell] series and a few more are in pipeline.

<small>This is a ["now page"] which itemizes the work and other priorities that I'm concentrating on right now.<br>This page was last updated on Jan 25, 2020.</small>
