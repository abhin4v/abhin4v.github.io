# What I'm Doing Now

I'm living in Bangalore, India and working at [Flipkart].

## Conferences

I'm preparing for presenting talks at two upcoming conferences:

1. [Many Ways to Concur] - [Functional Conf 2018], Bangalore
2. [Introduction to Concurrency in Clojure] - [In/Clojure 2019], Bangalore

## Advent of Code 2018

I'm solving [Advent of Code 2018] puzzles in Haskell. The aim is to explore [creative problem solving] in Haskell, to learn and implement interesting data structures and algorithms, and to learn a bit of category theory at the same time.

## Running

I'm [training] to run a half marathon for past couple of months. I'm yet to reach the 21km mark but I'm participating in few [10km][1] [runs][2] to keep up the tempo.

## Blogging

I'm planning to write more programming focussed blog posts. The last post for my [Fast Sudoku Solver in Haskell] series and a few more are in pipeline.
