# What I'm Doing Now

I'm living in Bangalore, India and working at [Flipkart].

## Reading

I'm trying to get back into the habbit of reading technical (and non-technical) books. The year 2018 was quite bad in terms of reading; I was able to read only four books. This year I'm planning to devote more time to reading and finish at least ten books.

## Running

I'm [training] to run a half marathon for past couple of months. I'm yet to reach the 21km mark but I'm participating in few [10km][1] [runs][2] to keep up the tempo.

## Blogging

I'm planning to write more programming focussed blog posts. The last post for my [Fast Sudoku Solver in Haskell] series and a few more are in pipeline.

## Teaching

I'm planning to teach various topics related to programming at public and non-public (at my workplace) workshops. I still need gather my thoughts around what I want to teach.
