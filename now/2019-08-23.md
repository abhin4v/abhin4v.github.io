# What I'm Doing Now

I'm living in Bangalore, India and working at [Flipkart].

## Conference

I'm planning (and preparing) to present in the [Functional Conf 2019].

## Reading

I'm trying to get back into the habit of reading technical (and non-technical) books. The year 2018 was quite bad in terms of reading; I was able to read only four books. This year I'm planning to devote more time to reading and finish at least ten books.

## Running

I'm [training] to run a half marathon race in [Bengaluru Marathon] for past couple of months. I'm yet to reach the 21km mark but I'm participating in [few][1] [10km][2] [races][3] to keep up the tempo.

## Blogging

I'm planning to write more programming focussed blog posts. The last post for my [Fast Sudoku Solver in Haskell] series and a few more are in pipeline.

## Teaching

I'm teaching various topics related to programming at [public][cljbridge] and non-public (at my workplace) workshops.
