In the recent past, we have seen a meteoric rise of Functional Programming languages like Clojure, Erlang and F# in enterprise application development. Even the well known OOP languages like Java now include FP features like lambdas.

In this talk, we will contrast the way applications are implemented in an OOP language (Java) vs a FP language (Clojure) by learning some common functional programming patterns.
