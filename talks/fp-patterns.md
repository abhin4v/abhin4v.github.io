In the recent past, we have seen a meteoric rise of Functional Programming languages like Clojure, Erlang and F# in enterprise application development. Even the well known OOP languages like Java now include FP features like lambdas.

In this talk, we will contrast the way back-end applications are implemented in an OOP language (Java) vs a FP language (Clojure) by learning some common functional programming patterns.
