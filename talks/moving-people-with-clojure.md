Go-Jek --- one of Indonesiaâ€™s fastest growing startups --- uses Clojure in production to efficiently provide courier, transport, and shopping services all over the country. This talk covers Go-Jek's journey of rewriting Allocation Service --- core of its business --- in Clojure. 

Allocation Service matches the best driver to each booking, from a fleet of hundreds of thousands of drivers. Switching to Clojure has enabled Go-Jek to ship new features at 5x speed compared to the previous (Golang) service. This talk shares the learnings, difficulties, and motivations for the same.
