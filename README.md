# abhin4v.github.io

![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/abhin4v/abhin4v.github.io.svg?branch=source)

This is the source for my personal website at [abhinavsarkar.net](https://abhinavsarkar.net).

The [master](https://github.com/abhin4v/abhin4v.github.io/tree/master) branch contains the static website which is generated from the code and the content in the [source](https://github.com/abhin4v/abhin4v.github.io/tree/source) branch.

It uses the [Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/) library as the base for static website generation, along with [Staticman](http://staticman.net/) for the static comments support. The custom code can be seen in the [source](https://github.com/abhin4v/abhin4v.github.io/tree/source) branch. Website styling is done with [scss](http://sass-lang.com) and interactivity is added using [JQuery](http://jquery.com).

The website is hosted with [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) with my domain name. HTTPS support is added with [Cloudflare](http://cloudflare.com/). Builds are done automatically using [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/abhin4v/abhin4v.github.io/).
