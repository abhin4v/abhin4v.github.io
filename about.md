# About Me

I am Abhinav Sarkar, a software developer currently living in Bangalore, India. I work[^linkedin]^,^[^stackoverflow] at [Nilenso Software]. When not making software[^github], I read books[^goodreads], play drums, listen to music[^last.fm] and ride[^strava] my bike.

Here are some talks and workshops I have presented in various conferences:

1. [Moving People with Clojure] - EuroClojure 2017, Berlin
1. [Introduction to Concurrency in Haskell] - Functional Conf 2015, Bangalore
1. [A Slow (and Hopefully Heedful) Ride Through ReactJS and Flux][1] - JSFoo 2015, Bangalore
1. [A Quick (and Hopefully Painless) Ride Through ReactJS][2] - Meta Refresh 2015, Bangalore

You can get in touch with me over Twitter[^twitter] or [email].

## About the Website

The source of the website can be found on my [github]. The [master] branch contains the static website which is generated from the code and the content in the [source] branch.

It uses the [Hakyll] library as the base for static website generation, along with [Staticman] for the static comments support. Website styling is done with [SCSS] and interactivity is added using [JQuery]. The PDF files are generated using headless [Google Chrome] browser with [this tool] running on [node.js].

The website is run using the [hastatic] server for [docker]. It is hosted on [Digital Ocean], behind [Cloudflare] for caching. Builds are done automatically using [Travis CI].
